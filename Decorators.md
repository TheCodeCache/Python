# First Class Functions:
Functions in Python are first class citizens.  
This implies that they support operations such as being, passed as an argument, returned from a function, modified, and assigned to a variable.  
This is a fundamental concept to understand before we delve into creating Python decorators.  

To know more about it, there is similar concepts in Scala as well. please refer [this](https://github.com/TheCodeCache/Scala/blob/master/First-Class%20Functions.md)  

When we decorate a component (be it a function, or a variable, or a class etc.),  
it essentially means that we're simply attaching extra behavior to the component.  

For ex (read the following):  
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decorator_pattern  

There is a thin line b/w annotation and decorator, to know more refer [this](https://stackoverflow.com/a/37317724/6842300)  

So, in Python, we've multiple types of decorators that applies to a:
1. Function
2. Class
