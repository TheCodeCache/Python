# Python Extensions:
Python Extension can be written in any langauge other than `C`, however with `C` has certain advantages over other languages.  

# Python C-Extension Module:
The C-extension in Python is nothing but `shared library`,  
on Unix, we call it as `.so` file (i.e. `shared object` or `binary file`), and  
on Windows, we call it as `.dll` i.e. `dynamic linked libraries`
